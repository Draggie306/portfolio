# portfoling

My personal portfolio site, visible at [oling.dev](https://oling.dev).

Built in raw HTML, CSS and JS. No fancy templates, frameworks or static site generators.

## Build instructions

The site can be run statically (e.g. GitHub/Cloudflare Pages) or with server-side logic (e.g. Cloudflare Workers).

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into it.
2. If you want to put the site behind a authwall or run server-side, run `npx wrangler dev` and `npx wrangler deploy`.
3. If not, copy the directory and open it in a browser, and click `index.html`.
