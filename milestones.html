                    Hello! I'm Oliver, an undergrad Computer Science and AI student at the University of Nottingham. I love making software, websites and utilities that have positive, tangible and real-world benefits. Beyond technology, I love learning & speaking different languages, and am interested in geography and photography, amongst many other things.
