                <h2>In a nutshell</h2>
                <p>I'm a Computer Science and AI (with Year-in-Industry) student at the University of Nottingham, currently in my first year. Within the field, I am particularly interested in full-stack development, AI & machine learning, networking, and software engineering. I have experience and like to challenge myself with a variety of programming languages, most notably: Python, C, C#, Java, TypeScript and the web stack.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, you'll find me developing personal projects (like this website!), working on my home lab, contributing to open-source projects, and many other recreational activities - see below!</p>

            <div class="about-page-info-section" id="my-history-info-section">
                <h2>My History</h2>
                <p>I was born in York, England in 2005 and, aside from 2 years living in Italy as a baby, I've spent most of my life in the UK, living in Norfolk. I've always attended local state schools; in high school, I developed an interest in technology, humanities and languages, including independently spending hours working on programming projects. I achieved 11 GCSEs, all between 9 and 7 including a 9 in English Language and 8 in Mathematics. Full academic results can be found <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-ling/details/education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
                <p>Then, I continued to study A Levels in French, Geography and Computer Science + an EPQ at <a href="https://ndhs.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notre Dame High School, Norwich</a>. I achieved A*AA and an A* in the EPQ and served many roles, most notably being elected as <a href="https://www.ndhs.org.uk/school-council" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Head Student</a>. During this time, my self-confidence grew significantly, I pushed myself academically, socially and beyond the curriculum, and I always attempted to do "a little bit extra" - a motto I continue to use today. Additionally, I went on a French exchange and stayed with a local family, co-founded the Geography Society, and even made a Python program to help the network team download and install software like Unreal Engine more effectively.</p>
                <p>After a (really) tough decision between which subject to study further and where to study it, I chose Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Nottingham</a>, where I started in 2024. It's allowed me to deepen my Computer Science knowledge whilst keeping my love for languages and humanities alive - having joined language societies and going on regular hikes into the Peak District.</p>

            <div class="about-page-info-section" id="my-interests-info-section">
                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>I am interested in many things both inside and outside technology and the Computer Science field.</p>
                <p>Beyond technology, I love learning languages. My French is at an estimated strong B2 level, and am learning Italian. In terms of humanities, I enjoy Geography (specialising in the intersection of physical and human geography), alongside History and Politics. When I'm not studying, coding or working, you'll see me going on long walks (walking marathon PB is 07:58:36!), playing badminton with friends, hiking (Helvellyn and Scafell Pike are my favourite), and reading. In recent years I've become more interested in photography too - my photos have been featured in places like BBC News - and in particular astrophotography, landscape and portrait photography.</p>
                <p>Within Computer Science however, I find architecting full-stack applications, crafting website experiences (like this one!), and applying AI and machine learning to real-world problems the most useful and interesting. Networking also plays a role in ensuring that my projects are satisfying to use. I hope to combine all these skills in my career and with projects that I create.</p>
