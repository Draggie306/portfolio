                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a Computer Science and AI (with Year-in-Industry) student at the University of Nottingham, currently in my first year. Within the field, I am particularly interested in full-stack development, AI and machine learning, networking, and software engineering. I have experience and like to challenge myself with a variety of programming languages: most notably Python, C, C#, Java, TypeScript and the web stack.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, you'll find me working on personal projects (like this website!), developing my home lab, contributing to open-source projects, or other recreational activities beyond coding - see below.</p>
