                <h2>In a nutshell</h2>
                <p>I'm a Computer Science and AI (with Year-in-Industry) undergraduate student at the University of
                    Nottingham, currently in my second year. Within the field, I particularly enjoy full-stack web/app
                    development, AI & machine learning, networking, and group software engineering. I have experience
                    and like to challenge myself with a variety of programming languages, most notably: Python, C, C#,
                    Java and TypeScript + the web stack.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, you'll find me developing group & personal projects (like this website!), working
                    on my home lab, contributing to open-source projects, writing blog posts and content for my
                    websites, and many other recreational activities - see below!</p>

                <h2>My History</h2>
                <p>I was born in York, England in 2005 and I've spent most of my life in the UK, in Norfolk. During high
                    school, my strengths were technology, humanities and languages; as a result, I spent many evenings
                    working on programming projects. I achieved 11 GCSEs (specifically 6 at Grade 9, 4 at Grade 8, and
                    one Grade 7) including a 9 in English Language and 8 in Mathematics. Full academic results can be
                    found <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-ling/details/education/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
                <p>Then, I studied A Levels in French, Geography and Computer Science and chose an additional EPQ on AI
                    at <a href="https://ndhs.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notre Dame High School,
                        Norwich</a>. I achieved A*AA and an A* in the EPQ and served many roles; most notably elected as
                    <a href="https://www.ndhs.org.uk/school-council" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Head
                        Student</a>. I pushed myself beyond the curriculum, and always attempted to do "a little bit
                    extra" - a motto I continue to use. Additionally, I stayed with a family during a French exchange,
                    co-founded the Geography Society, and even made a program to help the MAT's network admins download
                    and install software like Unreal Engine and Unity.</p>
                <p>After a (really) tough decision between which subject to study further and where to study it, I chose
                    Computer Science at the <a href="https://cs.nott.ac.uk/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Nottingham</a>, starting in 2024. It's allowed me to
                    deepen my Computer Science knowledge whilst keeping my love for languages and humanities alive,
                    having joined language societies and going on regular hikes into the Peak District.</p>
                <p>Within the university, I am a IT Service Desk "Smart Bar" Assistant, providing front-of-house support
                    to the student body with university systems and hardware and software issues. I'm also a
                    Residential Ambassador for 2 halls of residence, running events for students to make friendships and
                    settle in, in addition to being a Subject Ambassador. Within the School of Computer Science, I am a
                    mentor for 16 first-year students, answering questions regularly and helping them adjust to
                    university life.</p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>I am interested in many things both inside and outside technology and the Computer Science field.</p>
                <p>Beyond technology, I love learning languages. My French is at a B2 level; I'm also learning Italian.
                    I also enjoy the humanities, such as geography (specialising in the intersection of physical and
                    human geography), alongside history and politics. When I'm not studying, coding or working, you'll
                    see me on long walks, playing badminton with friends, hiking (Helvellyn and Scafell Pike are my
                    favourites), in addition to reading and sometimes writing. Recently, I've had the chance to develop
                    my photography skills - my photos have been featured in places like <a
                        href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7177mpgvro" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC News</a> - particularly astrophotography but also wide landscapes
                    and portrait shots.</p>
                <p>Within Computer Science however, I particularly find crafting fun, satisfying web and app experiences
                    (like this one!), applying AI and machine learning to real-world problems and designing full-stack
                    applications the most enjoyable, and also the most useful for others. I hope to combine all these
                    skills in my career and placement year.</p>
